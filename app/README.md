# The webapp

The webapp allows anyone to record a sound and upload it to the server. The neural network returns a prediction for the bird species.

The webapp can be found on https://chirps.eu

## How it works

We use Flask to serve the app. It consists of a simple index page with some <a href="static/app.js">javascript</a> for recording audio.
